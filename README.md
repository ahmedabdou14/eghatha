# Eghatha

A prototype of a novel local volunteer sourcing digital solution to deploy rescue teams in humanitarian crises and report incidents in real-time

## Problem Statement

Disaster victims need urgent help, yet government aid often arrives late and usually does not reach all victims. Existing crisis management frameworks do not count for individual micro contributions or volunteers, wasting potential. We need a faster, more inclusive solutions to bridge the gap between dire needs and timely assistance.

## Previous Attempts

Traditionally, national agencies assess the situation and declare a disaster area. Aid packages are formulated, approved, and then distributed through official channels. This can take weeks or even months. As of the public, they are often left in the dark about how they can help but donate money to large organizations that may or may not be able to reach all victims in time.

## Proposed Solution

Bypass the slow aid framework by creating a decentralized non-profit organization that provides a platform for the public to view and assess affected areas in their country and sign up to volunteer and join forces with the public in an organized and safe manner to provide immediate assistance to those hit the hardest.

## How it Works

Egatha puts disaster response directly in your hands. Open the platform to see a live map of your country, pinpointing areas facing emergencies. Click on any incident to see details, photos, and the crucial needs identified by local admins.

You can sign up to a rescue team for an affected area. We screen applicants based on skill requirements and offer them essential emergency training before deployment. Contribute your expertise, whether it's medical care, firefighting, logisitcs, or debris removal

Egatha mobilizes volunteers for quick "micro-tasks" that address urgent needs and save lives until professional help arrives. From providing food and water to clearing access routes, every contribution no matter the size makes a difference.

Eghatha is powered by the poeple, those who report incidents in the field or  volunteer admins who assess situations, allocate resources, and coordinate efforts. This real-time information ensures aid reaches those who need it the most. We work with local authorities to ensure safety and compliance with local laws and regulations. Our platform is designed to be transparent, secure, and accountable.

## Challenge

When it comes to crisis management within wars and genocide like that happening on our brothers and sisters in Gaza, where wifi has been cut off and basic necessities are scarce, it is difficult to coordinate between rescue teams. Maintaining connection with the team is an absolute necessity. In such heart-breaking scenarios, we utilize a cutting-edge mesh network technology to ensure that our volunteers can communicate and coordinate with each other even when the internet is down. It relies on the phones in the area acting as nodes to create a network that can be used to send messages and coordinate efforts. All communication proximities are updated real-time to Eghatha admin team to ensure no team gets stranded alone outside areas of coverage.

## Business Model

Eghatha is a non-profit yet financially self-sustainable organization. We rely on donations from the public and corporate social responsbility for corporations who want to publicize their support for disaster relief.

Such crises define an opportunity for organizations to show their philanthropy and commitment to social responsibility, Gaining them emmense public support so there should not be a shortage of funds.

All funds are used to maintain the platform, train volunteers, and provide essential supplies.

## Finally

I would like to remind everyone about the verse in Surat Al-Ma'idah, 5:32, "Whoever saves one life, it is as if he has saved all of humanity." We believe that every life is precious and that we can all make a difference. Eghatha is a platform for everyone to come together and make a difference.
